  <h1>TARAZ</h1> 
  <article>Taraz (Kazakh: Тараз, تاراز, romanized: Taraz (listeni); known to Europeans as Talas) is a city and the administrative center of Jambyl Region in Kazakhstan, located on the Talas (Taraz) River in the south of the country near the border with Kyrgyzstan. It had a population of 330,100 as of the 1999 census, up 9% from 1989, making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, after Astana and Turkistan. The current population of Taraz city is 428,000 (April 2023).[1]

    One of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan and in Transoxania, built and populated by the ancient Sogdians, Taraz celebrated its official 2,000th anniversary (recognized by UNESCO) in 2001, dating from a fortress built in the area by a Xiongnu Chanyu named Zhizhi, and was a site of the Battle of Zhizhi in 36 BCE.[2] The city was first recorded under the name "Talas" in 568 CE by Menander Protector. The medieval city of Talas was a major trade centre along the Silk Road. Talas was later described by Buddhist monk and traveller Xuanzang, who passed Talas in 629 and later wrote: "Traveling westward from the Thousand Springs 140 or 150 li, we come to the city of Daluosi. The city is 8 or 9 li in diameter; and was settled by Hu ("foreign, barbarian, non-Chinese") merchants from various nations. The products and the climate are about the same as Suyab."[3] The Talas alphabet, a variant of the Turkic "runiform" Orkhon script, is named for the town.
    
    Talas secured a place in history by virtue of the Battle of Talas (751 CE), which was fought between forces of the Chinese Tang dynasty and those of the Arab Abbasid Caliphate. The battle took place somewhere along the Talas River in the Talas valley. One of its indirect outcomes was the introduction of paper to the West, via the Arab capture of Chinese paper makers.</article>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<br> 
<article>Numerous archaeological finds and monuments in the foothills of Karatau and in Talas-Assin oasis show the antiquity of settlements in the Talas River valley, supporting Taraz's claim to being the most ancient city in Kazakhstan. The history of the city is composed of several historical periods, interrupted by destruction and depopulation. The first reference historically recorded city linked with Taraz and the basis for the claim of 2000-year-old history is the fortress of Zhizhi that briefly existed at the site of modern-day Taraz in the 1st century BCE.[citation needed] A city known as "Taraz" (or "Talas"[citation needed]) is then recorded in the 6th century CE[4] (568 CE[citation needed]) and is known to have existed until its decline in the 13th century.[4] The third historical period begins with the establishment of a Kokand fortress at the end of the 18th century, which in 1864 was named Auliye-Ata (from the Uzbek words meaning saint and father).[4] In 1936, the city was renamed Mirzoyan (Russian: Мирзоя́н), after Levon Mirzoyan.[4] After Mirzoyan's arrest in 1938, the city was renamed to Dzhambul (Russian: Джамбу́л), after the Kazakh traditional folksinger Jambyl Jabayev (Dzhambul Dzhabayev).[4] In 1993, the spelling of the city's name was officially changed to Jambyl/Dzhambyl (Kazakh: Жамбыл, Jambyl), and in 1997 the city was renamed Taraz.[5]

    The city started to assume its present form when Colonel Chernyev's detachment took over the Aulie Ata fortress and annexed it to the Russian Empire, starting in 1864. Taraz was greatly improved by the Semirechensky railway that passed through the town in 1917.</article>
